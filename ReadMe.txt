- Info:
On the last hit on Barnak the splitter splits all splits to the last and finishes the run.
Every major Item gets splitted, so that way you can make your own splits for 100% and gee%. Only the amount of splits counts. If you don't have enough splits then the autosplits on the next item will finish the run, if you don't go back a split manually.
If you want you can enable manual splitting in the settings. Then only the start and finish splits are automatic. You can split manually inbetween.
If you don't want the Game Time Prompt you can disable it in the settings
The splitter auto resets if you load into Manoir I from the main menu.
