Info
On the last hit on Barnak the splitter splits all splits to the last and finishes the run.
Every Item gets splitted, so that way you can make your own splits for 100% and gee%. Only the amount of splits counts. If you don't have enough splits then the autosplits on the next item will finish the run, if you don't go back a split manually.
As mentioned above:
If you want you can enable manual splitting in the /layout/autosplitter settings. Then only  the start and finish splits are automatic. You can split manually inbetween.
